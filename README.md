# Repeat Rate

If your mobile base requires constant updates on the cmd\_vel topic, teleop\_twist\_keyboard can be configured to repeat the last command at a fixed interval, using the `repeat_rate` private parameter.

For example, to repeat the last command at 10Hz:

```
rosrun teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard.py _repeat_rate:=10.0
```

It is _highly_ recommened that the repeat rate be used in conjunction with the key timeout, to prevent runaway robots.

# Key Timeout

Teleop\_twist\_keyboard can be configured to stop your robot if it does not receive any key presses in a configured time period, using the `key_timeout` private parameter.

For example, to stop your robot if a keypress has not been received in 0.6 seconds:
```
rosrun teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard.py _key_timeout:=0.6
```

It is recommended that you set `key_timeout` higher than the initial key repeat delay on your system (This delay is 0.5 seconds by default on Ubuntu, but can be adjusted).

# Twist with header
Publishing a `TwistStamped` message instead of `Twist` can be enabled with the `stamped` private parameter. Additionally the `frame_id` of the `TwistStamped` message can be set with the `frame_id` private parameter.
```
rosrun teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard.py _stamped:=True _frame_id:=base_link
```
